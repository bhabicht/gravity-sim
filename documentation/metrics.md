# Metrics
I experimented with a few tools, but i settled with Codacy, because it has a very good
integration of test coverage and it is overall very easy to setup and use with if you
use python as programming language.  
If will attach a screenshot [TODO].  
As you can see some of the calculated metrics are: Test coverage, SLOC ("Real" Lines of
Code) and Code quality.  
Another good property of codacy is that it is very easy to integrate with CI/CD, as you
can see in my CI/CD documentation [add Link] [TODO]
