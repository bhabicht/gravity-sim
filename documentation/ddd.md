# Domain Driven Design
Task as defined by Prof. Edlich:  
If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 5 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships  
Draw associations between the components.  
What data is shared? Do a little event storming.  
Think about relations mappings. Name them.  
I defined 3 Domains for my project:  
1.  Business logic (pure simulation code)
2.  Plotting
3.  Planet system creation
